This code can run on the raspberry pi zero, however it has not yet been proven to run continously.
A few tips to remember:
1. If you're using ssh, you need to use "screen" on the pi so it wont exit when you halt the ssh
2. You need to add the --max-old-space-size=200 parameter so garbage collection will start at 200mB and (hopefully) won't overflow the Pi's ram. This value may need to be tweaked depending on how the Pi operates.
3. The Raspi Zero uses ARM v6, meaning you cannot simply apt-get node, as the node distribution supports Raspi 3. Download the specific ARM v6 version through the node site. 
4. Adding comments may or may not cause the program to crash, https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/2970
